# Passive-Portofolio-Manager
The Passive Portfolio Manager is an effective tool for every passive investor. It is designed for managing a portfolio which contains index funds, bond funds, reits and other financial assets which have low trading frequency. Dynamic vectors hold the main data, like prices, invested amounts and fund units so the user can add as many assets and register investments as he/she likes. The data can be stored in files or it can be inputted via console. It calculates the main indicators that are important for a passive investor, like portfolio return, asset class return, net profit/loss, asset allocation, current market value. The user can calculate these indicators for the whole portfolio or for a specific asset class.  I really enjoyed building this a project, because it combines the two areas of which I am the most passionate about, computer science and investments.
